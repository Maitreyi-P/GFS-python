# GFS in Python

Scaled-down implementation of Google File System in Python, with a focus on fault tolerance and scalability. Done as part of the Distributed Systems (UE19CS400MC) course. The  implementation involves a multi-threaded python application where each component runs independent of the other. The Round Robin algorithm was used for chunk allocation and for allocating chunks to the backup chunkserver in case of failures.
